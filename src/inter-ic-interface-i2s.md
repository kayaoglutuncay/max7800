IÂ²S is a serial audio interface for communicating pulse-code modulation (PCM) encoded streams between devices. The peripheral supports both master and slave modes.

Key features:

- Stereo (2 channel) and mono (left or right channel option) formats
- Separate DMA channels for transmit and receive.
- Flexible timing:

    - Configurable sampling rate from 165536 to 1 of the I2S input clock.

- Flexible data format:

    - The number of bits per data word can be selected from 1 to 32, typically 8, 16, 24, or 32-bit width.
    - Feature enhancement not in the I2S specification.

        - Word/Channel select polarity control.
        - First bit position selection.
        - Selectable FIFO data alignment to the MSB or the LSB of the sample
        - Sample size less than the word size with adjustment to MSB or LSB of the word.
        - Optional sign extension.

- Full-duplex serial communication with separate I2S serial data input and serial data output pins
